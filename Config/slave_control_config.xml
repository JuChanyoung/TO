  <!--
    Used to set up a single communication channel with the master.
    There should be 2 streams for the control and video channels.
    - type: The type of the stream: "video", "control".
    - lport: The port that the slave is listening on.
    - rhost: The IP address of the master.
    - rport: The port that the master is listening on.
    - chunk-size: The size of a chunk in bytes. Frames will be split according to this.
    - receive-buffer-size: The size of the socket's receive buffer in bytes.
    - send-queue-length: The maximum number of frames queued for sending.
    - statistics: The configuration of the statistics associated with the stream.
                  OPTIONAL element. Should be associated with "control" type streams.
      - log-path: The location of the statistics log file.
      - log-name: The name of the statistics log file.
      - window: The size of the statistics window. Represents the number of control packets received after which the statistics are computed.
      - alpha: The coefficient used at the jitter filtering.

    Slave stream control:
    - mode: stream control mode
      = "static": fixed u value: u = u-max
      = "active": uses the local stream controller and ignores the received values from the master stream control
             "u-max", "u-min", "u-inc", "k-i", "delta", "mu" and "lambda" attributes are needed
    - log-path: the location of the stream control log file.
    - log-name: the name of the stream control log file.
    Attributes used in "static" mode:
    - u: the constant value of the control signal (i.e. video compression).
         Possible value range: [0-100]. Higher is better quality but bigger in size.
         Recommended value range: [10-90].
    Attributes used in "active" mode:
    - u-max: the maximum value for the control signal.
    - u-min: the minimum value for the control signal.
    - u-inc: the increment for the control signal.
    - k-i: the proportional coefficient used in the decreasing branch of the control law.
    - delta: the control threshold.
    - mu: the weight of the receive jitter variance used in the control error calculus.
    - lambda: the weight of the average delay used in the control error calculus.
