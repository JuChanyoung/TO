    <!--
      Used to set up a single communication channel with the slave.
      There should be 2 streams for the control and video channels.
      - type: The type of the stream: "video", "control".
      - lport: The port that the master is listening on.
      - rhost: The IP address of the slave.
      - rport: The port that the slave is listening on.
      - chunk-size: The size of a chunk in bytes. Frames will be split according to this.
      - receive-buffer-size: The size of the socket's receive buffer in bytes.
      - send-queue-length: The maximum number of frames queued for sending.
      - statistics: The configuration of the statistics associated with the stream.
                    OPTIONAL element. Should be associated with "control" type streams.
        - log-path: The location of the statistics log file.
        - log-name: The name of the statistics log file.
        - window: The size of the statistics window. Represents the number of control packets received after which the statistics are computed.
        - alpha: The coefficient used at the jitter filtering.
